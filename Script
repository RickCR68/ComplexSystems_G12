**[0:00 - 0:45] Part 1: Opening & Context**

"Good morning everyone, we are Group 12. The aim of our project is to examine a 
fascinating but difficult problem: the emergence of complex phenomena in turbulent flows. 

Turbulence is everywhere, but to really study how a flow system 'breaks' from smooth to 
chaotic, we needed a specific, extreme case study. That’s why we chose to focus on the 
Ground Effect phenomena in F1 cars. 

In F1, air isn't just flowing over the car; it's being squeezed between the car and the track. 
This creates a high-suction environment that is incredibly sensitive to changes—making it 
the perfect laboratory for our complexity analysis."


**[0:45 - 1:45] Part 2: Literature & Theory**

"To make our analysis rigorous, we anchored our research in three specific pieces of literature. 

First, to understand how the flow breaks, we looked at Yves Pomeau’s work on parallel flows. His 
theory of Subcritical Bifurcation is crucial for us. It predicts that our flow won't degrade 
gradually. Instead, Pomeau suggests we should see a sudden 'snap' into turbulence, where localized 
chaotic spots grow rapidly.

Second, to measure energy, we used Kolmogorov’s 1941 theory. This is the standard for 3D turbulence, 
predicting energy moves from big eddies to small ones, following a -5/3 power law.

However, our simulation uses the D2Q9 model, which is effectively 2D. So, we contrasted Kolmogorov 
with Kraichnan’s 1967 theory. Kraichnan argues that in 2D, energy can actually cascade inversely—from 
small scales up to large structures."

**[1:45 - 2:45] Part 3: Ground Effect Hypotheses**

"Moving to our specific research focus: Ground Effect.

Physically, as the car drops closer to the track, the air underneath accelerates due to the Venturi 
effect. Our goal was to pinpoint exactly when this accelerated flow breaks down.

To do this, we focused on two key variables.

First, we looked at Velocity. The big question here is how the flow transitions as speed increases. 
Our hypothesis is that it won't be a gradual degradation. Instead, we predict a subcritical bifurcation. 
This means we expect the flow to snap from smooth to turbulent in a sudden, sharp jump, rather than 
getting messy little by little.

Second, we looked at Ride Height. Here, we asked if the proximity of the track changes the physics. Our 
hypothesis is that the ground acts as a critical constraint, creating a specific 'tipping point'. We predict 
that below a certain height, the flow structure will undergo a fundamental phase transition that wouldn't 
happen in open air.

So, did our model support these predictions? I will now hand over to Ricardo to explain the Methods 
we used to find out."
