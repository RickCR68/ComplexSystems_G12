**[0:00 - 0:45] Part 1: Opening & Context**

"Good morning everyone, we are Group 12. The aim of our project is to examine a 
fascinating but difficult problem: the emergence of complex phenomena in turbulent flows. 

Turbulence is everywhere, but to really study how a flow system 'breaks' from smooth to 
chaotic, we needed a specific, extreme case study. That’s why we chose to focus on the 
Ground Effect phenomena in F1 cars. 

In F1, air isn't just flowing over the car; it's being squeezed between the car and the track. 
This creates a high-pressure environment that is incredibly sensitive to changes—making it 
the perfect laboratory for our complexity analysis."


**[0:45 - 1:45] Part 2: Literature & Theory**

"To make our analysis rigorous, we anchored our research in three specific pieces of literature. 

First, to understand how the flow breaks, we looked at Yves Pomeau’s work on parallel flows. His 
theory of Subcritical Bifurcation is crucial for us. It predicts that our flow won't degrade 
gradually. Instead, Pomeau suggests we should see a sudden 'snap' into turbulence, where localized 
chaotic spots grow rapidly.

Second, to measure energy, we used Kolmogorov’s 1941 theory. This is the standard for 3D turbulence, 
predicting energy moves from big eddies to small ones, following a -5/3 power law.

However, our simulation uses the D2Q9 model, which is effectively 2D. So, we contrasted Kolmogorov 
with Kraichnan’s 1967 theory. Kraichnan argues that in 2D, energy can actually cascade inversely—from 
small scales up to large structures. Checking which law our data follows—Kolmogorov or Kraichnan—was 
a key part of our analysis."

**[1:45 - 2:45] Part 3: Ground Effect Hypotheses**

"Moving to our specific research focus: Ground Effect.

Physically, as an F1 car drops closer to the track—reducing its 'Ride Height'—the air underneath 
accelerates. This is the Venturi effect. We asked ourselves: At what point does this accelerated 
flow break down? 

Our research was driven by two main hypotheses:

First, regarding the Reynolds Number: We hypothesized that as velocity increases, the flow 
field won't just get messy gradually. Instead, it will undergo a subcritical bifurcation. 
This means we expect a sudden, sharp jump from laminar to turbulent flow. 

Second, regarding the Ground: We asked, 'Does the track make a difference?' Our hypothesis is 
that the presence of the ground wall fundamentally changes the type of phase transition compared 
to open air. 

So, did our model support these hypotheses? I will now hand over to [Teammate's Name] to explain 
the Methods we used to find out."
